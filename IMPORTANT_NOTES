The arduino and teensys are by default operating at 100kHz I2C speeds.
This can be changed but has to be done in the Wire library.

Also the maximum I2C buffer length needs to be changed to be able
to send a complete NMEA sentence. Change in "Wire.h" (seperate files
for Arduino DUE and Teensy:

#define BUFFER_LENGTH 32 -> something new
